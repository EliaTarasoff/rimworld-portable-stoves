        <description>
            A portable archotech camping stove, that can boil water and cook basic food.
            It runs forever, and has no known fuel source; Not even an advanced radioisotope decay cell, or cold fusion.
            Built by an advanced AI, its exact function is beyond even the most sophisticated human scientists.
