I started this Rimworld mod, because I want more options for cooking food, and for custom game-start scenarios.
There's only a couple other mods I found that might work, and they're either incompatible with the latest game version,
or have a lot of other items I didn't necessarily want.

So, I made this mod, for just a few portable camping stoves.
